# Example BeeGFS HA (High-Availability) cluster inventory file.

# The basic function for Ansible inventory files are to define host groups. Group variables can be placed in a YAML file that corresponds to the group's name in
#   the group_vars/ directory. Likewise, host variables can be placed in a YAML file that has its name in the host_vars/ directory. Note that the names used for
#   Ansible host names do not need to correspond to the systems actual hostname; these are references only for Ansible automation.

        # Define all resource groups here for the BeeGFS cluster. At minimum you must have a management, metadata, and storage group. Create a 'hosts'
        #   dictionary containing the cluster node names you wish to be included in the resource group.

        # Notes:
        #   - The resource group's name must be less than 12 characters because the resource group is used to name the floating ip resource iflabel.
        #     * Step 3 in beegfs_ha_7_1 readme will prompt you to select the BeeGFS service (management, metadata, storage) you'd like the resource group to
        #         manage. Note that there can only be one management group.
        #   - The host names are used for the BeeGFS HA cluster node names (i.e. node_mm1, node_mm2). These names can be changed to whatever you'd like the nodes to be named.
        #   - The order of the cluster nodes in the hosts dictionary determines the resource's preference for the host, starting with the highest preference.


        # BeeGFS HA Management Resource Group - There can only be one BeeGFS HA management resource group; however, you can list as management failover hosts you'd like under hosts.
