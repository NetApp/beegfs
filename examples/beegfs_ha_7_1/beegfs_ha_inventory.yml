# Example BeeGFS HA (High-Availability) cluster inventory file.

# The basic function for Ansible inventory files are to define host groups. Group variables can be placed in a YAML file that corresponds to the group's name in
#   the group_vars/ directory. Likewise, host variables can be placed in a YAML file that has its name in the host_vars/ directory. Note that the names used for
#   Ansible host names do not need to correspond to the systems actual hostname; these are references only for Ansible automation.
